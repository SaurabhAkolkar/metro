        I launched android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe to
        start the installation process. The installer responded by
        presenting the Android Studio Setup dialog box shown in
        Figure 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img alt="" src="assets/images/a.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking Next took me to the following dialog box, which
        gives you the option to decline installing the Android SDK
        (included with the installer) and an Android Virtual Device
        (AVD).
      </p>

      </p>

        Figure 2. Do you want to install the Android SDK and AVD?
      </p><strong>I chose to keep the default settings. After
      clicking Next, you'll be taken to the license agreement
      dialog box. Accept the license to continue the
      installation.</strong>

        Figure 3. Accept the license agreement to continue
        installation
      </p>
      <p>
        The next dialog box invites you to change the installation
        locations for Android Studio and the Android SDK.

        installation locations
      </p>
      <p>
        Change the location or accept the default locations and
        click Next. The installer defaults to creating a shortcut
        for launching this program, or you can choose to decline. I
        recommend that you create the shortcut, then click the
        Install button to begin installation.

        The resulting dialog box shows the progress of installing
        Android Studio and the Android SDK. Clicking the Show
        Details button will let you view detailed information about
        the installation progress.The dialog box will inform you
        when installation has finished. When you click Next, you
        should see the following:

        To complete your installation, leave the Start Android
        Studio box checked and click Finish.
      </p><strong>Running Android Studio</strong>
      <p>
        Android Studio presents a splash screen when it starts
        running:

      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 7. Android Studio's start screen
      </p>
      <p>
        On your first run, you'll be asked to respond to several
        configuration-oriented dialog boxes. The first dialog box
        focuses on importing settings from any previously installed
        version of Android Studio.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        If you're like me, and don't have a previously installed
        version, you can just keep the default setting and click
        OK. Android Studio will respond with a slightly enhanced
        version of the splash screen, followed by the Android
        Studio Setup Wizard dialog box:

      </p><strong>Your first Android Studio mobile app</strong>
      <p>
        The quickest way to get to know Android Studio is to use it
        to develop an app. We'll start with a variation on the
        "Hello, World" application: a little mobile app that
        displays a "Welcome to Android" message. In the steps that
        follow, you'll start a new Android Studio project and get
        to know the project workspace, including the project editor
        that you'll use to code the app in Part 2.
      </p><strong>Starting a new project</strong>
      <p>
        From our setup so far, you should still have Android Studio
        running with the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box. From
        here, click Start a new Android Studio project. Android
        Studio will respond with the Create New Project dialog box
        shown in Figure 15.

      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 15. Create a new project
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter W2A (Welcome to Android) as the application name and
        javajeff.ca as the company domain name. You should then see
        C:\Users\jeffrey\AndroidStudioProjects\W2A as the project
        location. Click Next to select your target devices.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 16. Select your target device categories
      </p>
      <p>
        Android Studio lets you select form factors, or categories
        of target devices, for every app you create. I would have
        preferred to keep the default API 15: Android 4.0.3
        (IceCreamSandwich) minimum SDK setting (under Phone and
        Tablet), which is supported by my Amazon Kindle Fire HD
        tablet. Because Android Studio doesn't currently support
        this API level (even when you add the 4.0.3 system image
        via the SDK Manager), I changed this setting to API 14:
        Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich), which is also supported by
        my tablet. Click Next, and you will be given the
        opportunity to choose a template for your app's main
        activity. For now we'll stick with Empty Activity. Select
        this template and click Next.

        Next you'll customize the activity:

      <p>
        Figure 18. Customize your activity Enter W2A as the
        activity name and main as the layout name, and click Finish
        to complete this step. Android Studio will respond that it
        is creating the project, then take you to the project
        workspace.

      <p>
        Figure 19. Android Studio workspace
      </p>
      <p>
        The project workspace is organized around a menu bar, a
        tool bar, a work area, additional components that lead to
        more windows (such as a Gradle Console window), and a
        status bar. Also note the Tip of the Day dialog box, which
        you can disable if you like.
      </p><strong>Accessing AVD Manager or SDK Manager from menu
      and tool bar</strong>
      <p>
        To access the traditional AVD Manager or SDK Manager,
        select Android from the Tools menu followed by AVD Manager
        or SDK Manager from the resulting pop-up menu (or click
        their tool bar icons).
      </p><strong>The project and editor windows</strong>
      <p>
        When you enter the project workspace, W2A is identified as
        the current project, but you won't immediately see the
        project details. After a few moments, these details will
        appear in two new windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figure 20. The project and editor windows
      </p>
      <p>
        The project window is organized into a tree whose main
        branches are App and Gradle Scripts. The App branch is
        further organized into manifests, java, and res
        subbranches:
      </p>
      <p>
        • manifests stores AndroidManifest.xml, which is an XML
        file that describes the structure of an Android app. This
        file also records permission settings (where applicable)
        and other details about the app.<br />
        • java stores an app's Java source files according to a
        package hierarchy, which is ca.javajeff.w2a in this
        example.<br />
        • res stores an app's resource files, which are organized
        into drawable, layout, mipmap, and values
        subbranches:<br />
        • drawable: an initially empty location in which to store
        an app's artwork• layout: a location containing an app's
        layout files; initially, main.xml(the main activity's
        layout file) is stored here.<br />
        • mipmap: a location containing various ic_launcher.png
        files that store launcher screen icons of different
        resolutions<br />
        • values: a location containing colors.xml, dimens.xml,
        strings.xml, and styles.xml The Gradle Scripts branch
        identifies various .gradle (such as build.gradle) and
        .properties (such as local.properties) files that are used
        by the Gradle-based build system.<br />
      </p><strong>Branch names and directory/file names</strong>
      <p>
        Each branch/sub-branch corresponds to a directory name or
        to a file name. For example, res corresponds to the res
        directory and strings.xml corresponds to the strings.xml
        file.

        If you don't have an Android Studio project already, you
        can download one of our quickstart samples if you just want
        to try a Firebase feature. If you're using a quickstart,
        remember to get the application ID from the build. Gradle
        file in your project's module folder (typically app/), as
        you'll need this package name for the next step.

      <h4>
        Add Firebase to your app
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you're using Android Studio version 2.2 or later, the
        Firebase Assistant is the simplest way to connect your app
        to Firebase. The Assistant can connect your existing
        project or create a new one for you with all the necessary
        gradle dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're using an older version of Android Studio or have
        a more complex project configuration, you can still
        manually add Firebase to your app.

        project (or Add Firebase if you're using an existing
        project) to begin provisioning resources for your project.
        This typically takes a few minutes. When the process

        Use the Firebase Assistant
      </h4>
      <h6>
        To open the Firebase Assistant in Android Studio:
      </h6>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Click <strong>Tools &gt; Firebase</strong> to open the
        Assistant window.
        </li>
        <li>Click to expand one of the listed features (for
        example, Analytics), then click the provided tutorial link
        (for example, Log an Analytics event).
        </li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Connect to Firebase</strong> button
        to connect to Firebase and add the necessary code to your
        app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now that you have a project, you can add your Android app
        to it:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click Add Firebase to your Android app and follow the
        setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google
        project, this may happen automatically and you can just
        download the config file.
        </li>
        <li>When prompted, enter your app's package name. It's
        important to enter the package name your app is using; this
        can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase
        project.
        </li>
        <li>During the process, you'll download a
        google-services.json file. You can download this file again
        at any time.
        </li>
        <li>After you add the initialization code, run your app to
        send verification to the Firebase console that you've
        successfully installed Firebase.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>
        Add the SDK
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you would like to integrate the Firebase libraries into
        one of your own projects, you need to perform a few basic
        tasks to prepare your Android Studio project. You may have
        already done this as part of adding Firebase to your app.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, add rules to your root-level build.gradle file, to
        include the google-services plugin and the Google's Maven
        repository:
      </p><img src="assets/images/firebase1.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Then, in your module Gradle file (usually the
        app/build.gradle), add the apply plugin line at the bottom
        of the file to enable the Gradle plugin:
      </p><img src="assets/images/firebase2.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        You should also add the dependencies for the Firebase SDKs
        you want to use. We recommend starting with
        com.google.firebase:firebase-core, which provides Google
        Analytics for Firebase functionality. See the list of
        available libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this App firebase is already integrated you can generate
        <strong>google-services.json</strong> on firebase console
        <a href=
        "https://firebase.google.com/">https://firebase.google.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        After going to this given website follow these steps :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on go to console
        </li>
        <li>sign in with your google account
        </li>
        <li>add project
        </li>
        <li>generate <strong>google-services.json</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Replace with given file in screeshot
        </li>
      </ul><img src="assets/images/pay3.png" alt="" /><br>
      <h3>Firebase Chat Integration</h3>
      <h5>Enable Authentication</h5>
<p>Let's require a user to sign in before reading or posting any Friendly Chat messages.<br>

Firebase Realtime Database Rules
Access to your Firebase Database is configured by a set of rules written in a JSON configuration language.<br>

Go to your project in the Firebase console and select Database. Select Get Started in the Realtime Database option. When prompted for security rules, choose to start in either test mode or locked mode, choose test mode. Once the default rules are established, select the Rules tab and update the rules configuration with the following:<br></p>
<img src="assets/images/authentication.png" alt="" />

<p style="color:green;font-weight: 800;">{<br>
 &nbsp; "rules": {<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ".read": "auth != null",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;".write": "auth != null"<br>
  &nbsp;}<br>
}</p>
<p>For more information on how this works (including documentation on the "auth" variable) see the Firebase security documentation.<br>

Configure Authentication APIs <br>
Before your application can access the Firebase Authentication APIs on behalf of your users, you will have to enable it <br>

Navigate to the Firebase console and select your project <br>
Select Authentication <br>
Select the Sign In Method tab <br>
Toggle the Google switch to enabled (blue) <br>
Press Save on the resulting dialog</p>
